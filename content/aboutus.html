                    Despite his excellent work ethic, Julian faces his own challenges. He tends to have a mild addiction to computers, which can sometimes distract him from his tasks.

Another, more serious aspect is that there are reports of slaves in the basement, which is absolutely unacceptable and not in line with Team04's values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite these challenges, Michael has an enormously positive impact on our team. His creativity and sense of aesthetics have significantly shaped Team04's visual identity.
